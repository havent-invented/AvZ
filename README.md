### Game Description
**The Curers** is a fast-paced, level-based FPS blending action and strategy. Players must cure infected zombies, tackle escalating challenges, and manage scarce resources to survive. Each level tests adaptability and decision-making.

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Zombie Threats:** Combat requires quick reflexes and tactical movement.
- **Resource Management:** Supplies are limited—players must gain and spend resources wisely.
- **Safe House Economy:** Purchase items between levels to progress forward in the game 
- **High Stakes Survival:** Heal the zombies and reach the evacuation point to win. Failure costs resources and rewards.

**Infection Mechanic:**

- **Escalating Threat:** Infection levels intensify every 30 seconds, demanding swift action.
- **Antidote Use:** Cure zombies by administering antidotes under strict conditions (close range, health < 50%). Misuse wastes resources.
